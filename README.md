# cyberMusicProject

## Introduction: This is my own music project,and my first real project. 

##If you are interested in my project,just send message to me! awa~~

The front end and back end of this project are separate. The front end is pure native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while the back end is currently built using the Express framework.

## How to use the backend?

```bash
cd ./backend
npm run dev
```

## How to use the frontend?

As is konwn to all Live Server is a good plugin in VScode,so just Install Live Server and run with it,if the project does not work, you can check the actually host and port, change it carefully.
After that,you can see my project finally.
